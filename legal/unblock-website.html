<h1>Website Unblocking Policy</h1>

<p>This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for requesting the unblocking of websites that have been mistakenly blacklisted by RobuxGuardian. We aim to ensure a safe online environment for the Roblox community while allowing legitimate websites access.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility for Unblocking</h2>
<p>Requests for unblocking will be considered under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The website must provide legitimate services or content.</li>
    <li>The website should not be involved in any scams, phishing attempts, or activities targeting minors.</li>
    <li>The requestor must provide sufficient evidence supporting their claim for unblocking.</li>
</ul>
